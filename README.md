# nocartax.com
nocartax.com is a site I built for a client. Mr. Allman sent me a text file with exactly what he wanted his site to look like and I delivered. He made no request for a footer but I added it in as I think it makes it look modern. nocartax.com works on any device and was made using HTML, CSS, and Tailwind.
